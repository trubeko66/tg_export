# Duplicate Notification Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
The user reported receiving three duplicate notifications in Telegram for successful exports, indicating that notifications were being sent multiple times during the export process.

## Root Cause
The duplicate notifications were caused by recursive calls to the [export_channel](file:///C:/Users/trubeko/tg_export-1/telegram_exporter.py#L1877-L2401) method in several scenarios:
1. During MD file verification process
2. During FloodWaitError handling
3. During batch export operations (_export_missing_md_channels, export_all_channels)

Each recursive call was sending its own notification, resulting in multiple notifications for a single logical export operation.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Notification Control Mechanism
- Introduced a `_in_md_verification` flag to track when the export process is in a recursive or batch mode
- This flag prevents duplicate notifications during recursive calls

### 2. Fixed MD Verification Recursive Calls
Modified the MD file verification section in [export_channel](file:///C:/Users/trubeko/tg_export-1/telegram_exporter.py#L1877-L2401) to:
- Set `_in_md_verification = True` before recursive calls
- Properly restore the flag after recursive calls using try/finally blocks
- Prevent notifications during recursive export operations

### 3. Fixed FloodWaitError Handling
Updated the FloodWaitError handling in [export_channel](file:///C:/Users/trubeko/tg_export-1/telegram_exporter.py#L1877-L2401) to:
- Set `_in_md_verification = True` before recursive calls
- Restore the original flag value after the recursive call
- Prevent duplicate notifications during retry attempts

### 4. Fixed Missing MD Files Export
Modified the [_export_missing_md_channels](file:///C:/Users/trubeko/tg_export-1/telegram_exporter.py#L2856-L2914) method to:
- Set `_in_md_verification = True` at the beginning of the process
- Restore the original flag value at the end using try/finally blocks
- Prevent notifications during the batch export of channels without MD files

### 5. Fixed Scheduled Export of All Channels
Updated the [export_all_channels](file:///C:/Users/trubeko/tg_export-1/telegram_exporter.py#L1823-L1854) method to:
- Set `_in_md_verification = True` at the beginning of the process
- Restore the original flag value at the end using try/finally blocks
- Prevent notifications during the batch export of all channels

## Message Counting Logic Verification
The message counting logic was already correct:
- `session_filtered_count` properly tracks filtered messages during the current export session
- This count is correctly added to `self.stats.filtered_messages` at the end of the export
- The calculation "useful messages = total messages - promotional messages" works as expected
- No changes were needed to the message counting logic

## Files Modified
- `telegram_exporter.py`: Applied all the notification control fixes

## Expected Result
After these changes, the user should receive only one notification per actual export operation, eliminating the duplicate notifications issue while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Testing Recommendation
To verify the fix:
1. Run the exporter and monitor for duplicate notifications
2. Confirm that a single successful export triggers only one notification
3. Verify that message counting logic still works correctly
4. Confirm that error handling and verification processes don't send duplicate notifications

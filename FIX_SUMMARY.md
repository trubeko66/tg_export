# Fix Summary: Duplicate Telegram Notifications Issue

## Problem Description
The user reported receiving three duplicate notifications in Telegram for successful exports, indicating that notifications were being sent multiple times during the export process.

## Root Cause Analysis
After analyzing the code, I identified several causes for the duplicate notifications:

1. **Recursive calls during MD file verification**: The `export_channel` method was being called recursively during MD file verification, which would trigger multiple notifications.

2. **Recursive calls during FloodWaitError handling**: When encountering FloodWait errors, the code was making recursive calls to `export_channel` without preventing duplicate notifications.

3. **Missing MD files export process**: The `_export_missing_md_channels` method was calling `export_channel` for multiple channels without proper notification control.

4. **Scheduled export of all channels**: The `export_all_channels` method was calling `export_channel` for each channel without preventing duplicate notifications.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Notification Control Flag
I introduced a `_in_md_verification` flag to track when the export process is in a recursive or batch mode where notifications should be suppressed.

### 2. Fixed MD Verification Recursive Calls
Modified the MD file verification section to:
- Set the `_in_md_verification` flag before recursive calls
- Properly restore the flag after recursive calls
- Prevent notifications during recursive export operations

### 3. Fixed FloodWaitError Handling
Updated the FloodWaitError handling to:
- Set the `_in_md_verification` flag before recursive calls
- Restore the original flag value after the recursive call
- Prevent duplicate notifications during retry attempts

### 4. Fixed Missing MD Files Export
Modified the `_export_missing_md_channels` method to:
- Set the `_in_md_verification` flag at the beginning of the process
- Restore the original flag value at the end
- Prevent notifications during the batch export of channels without MD files

### 5. Fixed Scheduled Export of All Channels
Updated the `export_all_channels` method to:
- Set the `_in_md_verification` flag at the beginning of the process
- Restore the original flag value at the end
- Prevent notifications during the batch export of all channels

## Message Counting Logic
The message counting logic was already correct:
- `session_filtered_count` tracks filtered messages during the current export session
- This count is properly added to `self.stats.filtered_messages` at the end of the export
- The calculation "useful messages = total messages - promotional messages" is implemented correctly

## Files Modified
- `telegram_exporter.py`: Applied all the fixes mentioned above

## Testing
The changes ensure that:
1. Notifications are only sent once per actual export operation
2. Recursive calls during error handling or verification processes don't trigger duplicate notifications
3. Batch operations (export all channels, export missing MD files) don't send multiple notifications
4. Message counting logic remains accurate

## Verification
To verify the fix:
1. Run the exporter and monitor for duplicate notifications
2. Check that a single successful export triggers only one notification
3. Verify that message counting logic still works correctly
4. Confirm that error handling and verification processes don't send duplicate notifications
